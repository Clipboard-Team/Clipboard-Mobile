## Basic Overview

I have a strong value for team management and organization. Applications like JIRA and Trello have inspired me to develop my own project management application.
This is the iOS version of Clipboard for users who are on the go and need to quickly add or update a task, or manage their team.
Users can create new projects, teams, and assign tasks in a smooth and user-friendly process.
